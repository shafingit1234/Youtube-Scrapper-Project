# Youtube-Scrapper-Project

## Brief Overview About the Application:
I made a simple webÂ application that asks users to enter the URL of a YouTube video. When you press enter, the Python-based project's core logic extracts some information, such as the video's title, number of likes, comments, and length, and presents it on a webpage in tabular fashion.
The details that were scraped off are afterwards saved in a mongodb database for later analysis.
